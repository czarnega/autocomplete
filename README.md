# autocomplete
Autocomplete library which builds a dictionary based on input text file and uses no external libraries.

## Directions for Use

### For CLI autocomplete testing
1. Clone repository to your local machine, and cd into project directory.
2. Run `node initialize.js`
3. When prompted, enter prefix/word to search for.
4. Type 'y' to run again, or 'n' to exit program.

### For use in application
1. Import autocomplete into file `const AutoComplete = require('./lib/autocomplete');`

2. Create options object to pass to AutoComplete ```
const options = {
  file: FILE_TO_USE_AS_DICTIONARY,
  resultLimit: NUMBER_OF_RESULTS,
  descending: BOOLEAN
};
```

3. Call AutoComplete function, passing options object as first parameter, and callback function as second parameter. Callback function should accept an error object as first parameter and the suggestTree as the second parameter.

### SuggestTree API
The SuggestTree class has the following methods:

`add` which accepts a word string and inputs it into the SuggestTree

`getDictionary` which accepts no parameters, and returns all complete words in the SuggestTree

`getMatches` which accepts a token string of alphabetic characters and returns matching complete words, limited to the resultLimit specified in options and ordered by descending property in options.

Autocomplete Problem
====================

Create a Ruby library that can autocomplete word fragments using a text file as the data source.

* You should be able to index the autocomplete-able words from any text file (feel free to ignore non-word entities like numbers)
* When returning the list of autocompleted words for a word fragment, it should order the words by their frequency (most frequent first)
* It should also return the frequency of each word as part of the results
* It should return no more than 25 results for any word fragment
* Use the provided complete works of Shakespeare and include your results for the following fragments: th, fr, pi, sh, wu, ar, il, ne, se, pl

There are various decisions and minor differences that go into different solutions, so don't worry about precise results matching up with our own â€“ we're not going to evaluate it like that. Also, I'm not going to give you specific class/module structure since I think these decisions are part of the problem. We'll be evaluating your solution based on your approach to the problem (algorithm), readability/maintainability/style, and performance characteristics. Only include any tests if it helps you, we won't penalize or judge you for not having them. 

Just send back a tar'd gzip of your solution, with any instructions if necessary with how to use it. If you have any questions, feel free to Skype or email me.

NOTE: You must use pure Ruby - no third-party gems, data stores, etc. However, feel free to use any reference resources, just make sure to cite anything you use (aside from the obvious Ruby docs, etc).
